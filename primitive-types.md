## Javascript Primitive Types

** Javascript is dynamically typed. Variables types are determined on the fly.

* ``` undefined``` - Represents a lack of exsistence - reserved for the engine. Don't assign values to it.
* ``` Null``` - Also represents a lack of exsitence, this value can be set by the user.
* ``` Boolean``` - ```true``` or ```false``` in lower case.
* ``` Number``` - Javascript only has floating point numbers. Note - Makes math strange in JS.
* ``` string``` - '' and "" can be used. Quite simple in JS.
* ``` symbol``` - Used in ECMA script 6 - not fully supported yet.
